## Problem defenition
(Not sure what product yet. Most likely wine, whiskey or guitars)
Marktplaats is not a product specicif site. Some (expensive) products require extra (important) searching criteria such as region or year (wine). Furthermore user experience is not optimal. After wanting to buy an item on markplaats, you have to email or text the seller. There is no in-application chat.

## Problem solving
The application will let users upload a clear description of there products (wine, or the others) for sale. Buyers can find these products, and start a conversation with the seller in a private (in-app) chat. Users have an overview of their chats. 

## Data sets
Users will be registered on firebase, and upload products from their account. Therefore for each product the seller will be known, and users can start a chat with that seller in an firebase realtime database chat.

## Parts of application
* Login/register
* Add product 
* Search for products
* Chat

All products added by any user will be available for users when searching. Users can start a chat with another user when they would like to buy/discuss a product.
